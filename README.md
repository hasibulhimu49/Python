- [ ] Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment, Bitwise)

## 2. Control Flow
- [ ] Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
- [ ] Loops (for, while)
- [ ] Loop Control (break, continue, pass)
- [ ] List Comprehensions

## 3. Functions & Modules
- [ ] Defining and Calling Functions (def, return)
- [ ] Function Arguments (positional, keyword, default, variable-length *args, **kwargs)
- [ ] Lambda (Anonymous Functions)
- [ ] Importing and Using Modules
- [ ] Writing and Using Custom Modules

## 4. Data Structures
- [ ] Lists (Operations, Slicing, Methods)
- [ ] Tuples (Immutable Lists)
- [ ] Sets (Unique Items, Set Operations)
